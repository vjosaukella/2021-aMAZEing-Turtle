#   a124_TR_maze4_random.py
#   Example solution 4:
#      Code generates a square, and spirals outward as the foundation of a maze.
#      The spiral now has doors/openings at random intervals.
#      The spiral has barrier walls at random intervals.
#      This code ensures walls and doors do not render on top of each other.
